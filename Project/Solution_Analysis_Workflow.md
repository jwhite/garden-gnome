# Overall workflow to examine features in this application

## Requirements

Analyse the Background.md file and suggest a more refined requirements gathering document. Create a few user personas.  Store the outcome in Requirements.md in the business analysis folder and then wait for my feedback.

## Refine

Can you suggest additional requirements and potential features that might be interesting to the user personas?  Store those in the Requirements document.

## Features

Create a list of features that will be created in a stepwise fashion.  Prioritise these logically. Store the feature list in Features.md in the Business Analysis folder.  Wait for my feedback.

## Prioritise

Create a list of feature implementation steps starting with an MVP and ending in a full featured application.  Make the list in priority order, and make each feature implementation step small enough to be quickly implemented to check the direction.
