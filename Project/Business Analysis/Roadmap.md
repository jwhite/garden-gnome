# Garden Gnome Application - Implementation Roadmap

## 1. Implementation Roadmap Overview

The Garden Gnome development strategy follows an iterative, user-value-driven approach that prioritizes early validation and continuous delivery. The roadmap has been strategically simplified to eliminate multi-user complexity in the MVP phase, focusing instead on comprehensive plant and seed inventory features that provide immediate gardening value.

**Core Principles:**
- **Offline-First Development**: Core functionality works without internet connectivity, perfect for garden use
- **Data Ownership**: Users own their data locally, with easy export/import capabilities
- **Gardening Season Alignment**: Key features launch to align with natural gardening cycles for maximum adoption
- **Progressive Complexity**: Simple, reliable features establish trust before introducing cloud-based features
- **No Registration Barriers**: Users can start immediately without account creation friction

**Strategic MVP Simplification:**
By removing multi-user features from the MVP, we achieve:
- **75% faster time to market** (12 weeks vs 16 weeks)
- **70% lower initial development cost** ($66k vs $280k)
- **Zero infrastructure complexity** during initial validation
- **Perfect offline functionality** for garden/greenhouse use
- **No privacy concerns** with local data storage
- **Immediate user value** through comprehensive plant/seed databases

**Development Philosophy:**
The roadmap recognizes that gardening is inherently personal and experiential. Users need comprehensive plant and seed information immediately, with the ability to plan and track without barriers. Multi-user features can be added later once core value is validated and proven.

## 2. MVP Definition and Scope
