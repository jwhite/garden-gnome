This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new "garden-gnome" project that has not yet been initialized with any code, configuration files, or dependencies. The repository is currently empty except for this documentation file.  The intention is that this project will be a dockerised application that runs vue and connects to a back end database.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project without any existing configuration:

1. The project type and technology stack have not been determined yet
2. No package.json, build scripts, or dependency management files exist
3. No source code structure has been established

## Next Steps for Development

When setting up this project, consider:

1. Initialize with appropriate package manager (npm, yarn, etc.) if it's a JavaScript/TypeScript project
2. Set up build tools and development scripts
3. Establish project structure and architecture
4. Add linting, testing, and formatting configurations
5. Create appropriate development and build commands

## Notes

- This project is not yet a git repository
- No existing code patterns or conventions to follow
- Architecture and development workflows need to be established based on project requirements
